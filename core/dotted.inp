% #4 line steepness m

% Interpret the different options to be used for printing a dot
% The optional arguments (passed as #1)given by the user are taken into account,
% then the scaling and raise are calculated using the design options 
% from the calling predefined command.
% Finally the space between the glyph and the dot is calculated using the
% 2nd order function \lilyCalcDotSpace:
% (1/n * scale^2) - 1/n + (1/m * scale) - 1/m + o
% #2: curve factor n
% #4 line steepness m
% #3 offset o (offset of 0 results in a dotSpace of 0 at scale=1).

\newcommand*{\lilyPrintDot}{\lilyDot[raise=\lilyDotRaise,scale=\lilyDotScale]}

% It uses the dot settings from the previous command.
% So if you encounter strange settings, make sure you have called
% a predefined command of a dotted symbol immediately before.
% If no predefined command has been called at all
% you will see an error message because the key-value pairs 
% haven't been initialized yet.
% It uses a different way to determine the space between dots.
% It defaults to 0.25 ex, but you can optionally pass it
% a number that is interpreted as ex.
